## Simple quine in C

I got inspired by Yusuke Endoh's quine videos, hopefully I can make a cooler quine at some point.

This is my first quine, not sure if it's the simplest but it definitely doesn't do much.

```console
gcc quine.c -o quine
./quine
```

```console
gcc quine2.c -o quine2
./quine2
```
